<!DOCTYPE html>
<!--
    index.html - The Main File
    
    This is an HTML file. HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the language
    that structures the content of web pages. Think of it as the skeleton
    of your website - it defines what content appears and how it's organized.
    
    The <!DOCTYPE html> at the top tells the browser "this is an HTML document".
    Everything else is wrapped in HTML tags, which are like labels that tell
    the browser what each part is (like a heading, paragraph, link, etc.).
-->
<html lang="en">
<!--
    <html> is the root tag - everything goes inside this.
    lang="en" tells the browser the page is in English.
-->
<head>
    <!--
        <head> contains information about the page that users don't see directly,
        but browsers and search engines use. Like the page title, character encoding,
        and links to CSS files.
    -->
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <!--
        charset tells the browser how to interpret characters.
        UTF-8 includes most characters from all languages.
    -->
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <!--
        viewport meta tag makes the page responsive - it works well on
        phones, tablets, and computers by adjusting to the screen size.
    -->
    <title>Portfolio - Abhiram</title>
    <!--
        <title> shows up in the browser tab and when you bookmark the page.
    -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
    <!--
        This links to the CSS file that styles this page.
        CSS controls colors, fonts, spacing, layout - how things look.
    -->
</head>
<body>
    <!--
        <body> contains all the visible content that users see on the page.
    -->
    <header>
        <!--
            <header> is a semantic tag - it represents the top section
            of a page, typically containing a logo and navigation.
        -->
        <nav>
            <!--
                <nav> represents navigation links (menu items).
            -->
            <div class="logo">Portfolio</div>
            <ul class="nav-links">
                <!--
                    <ul> is an unordered list (bullet points).
                    <li> are list items.

            <!--
                <section> groups related content together.
                id="home" lets us link directly to this section (see nav links above).
                class="hero" adds a CSS class for styling - we'll style this as a hero section.
            -->
            <h1>Abhiram Chandrasekhar</h1>
            <!--
                <h1> is the main heading (largest heading).
                This displays your full name prominently in the hero section.

            <p class="tagline">Building decentralized systems and blockchain infrastructure</p>
            <!--
                <p> is a paragraph tag for regular text.
                class="tagline" styles this as a tagline - a short description
                that appears below your name. This tells visitors what you do.
